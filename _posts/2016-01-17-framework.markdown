After the four plus weeks of ruby logic problems we are finally seeing it all work in the beautiful MVC frame work that is Rails. BUT FIRST HTML & CSS!!! 

Starting the week with 8 hours of HTML and CSS was kind of rough. HTML and CSS to me are pretty straight forward and to be honest very boring in comparison to object oriented languages. I did however really enjoy learning about SCSS and Bootstrap. I really need to put time aside and play around with it so I’ll be ahead of the curve come capstone time. 

Onward to Rails!!! This was my first time working with rails outside of a quick code-academy tutorial. It was great to see how the logic in ruby come together and works on rails. I finally got a glimpse into the future of working as a web dev and the process of making apps. Initially I had a few hiccups with following the flow of route to controller to view.  I kept finding myself running into errors because my controllers didn’t match my views.  It all eventually clicked on day two of working with Rails. 

Overall this week was very exciting. Everything is all coming together and I can’t wait to learn Java Script. Now all I need to do is to commit to a capstone idea.....
