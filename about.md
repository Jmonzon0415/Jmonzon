My names is Joshua Monzon, I am an aspiring web developer enrolled at ACLTC. My whole life I assumed my career path was geared towards the medical field, but after a few years of college and wasted tuition I came to the realization that it was not my passion. I found myself at a critical cross road in my life; do I change my major, keep working in soul crushing hourly jobs or find another route to a career where I am truly happy and rewarded? 
  
I knew my cousin went to a coding bootcamp in Chicago after not finding a stable job with his degree. I didn't know anything about what web developers do or how software was really made, but he told me to check out code-academy.com and see if it is some thing that was interesting to me. One night after work I checked it out and did a few ruby tutorials and fell in love with it. Watching lines of code I wrote affecting the output on the terminal had me giddy! I did a few more HTML, CSS, and Ruby tutorials and immediately knew this was something I could do as a job. For the first time I felt I could work towards something that can actually be rewarding. So I took the plunge, saved up for a year and moved to Chicago to pursue a tangible career. 
   
I truly believe the internet is the greatest invention in the world. A medium to communicate and share mass amounts of information. So why not work with it in career where we can create beautiful and meaningful things.
